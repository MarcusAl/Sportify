## Description

Sportify is an app for renting tennis locations across the UK using an AirBnb type marketplace system. A seller can rent out their court, and a renter can hire a court. The web-app has login/sign up functionality, and sellers can upload pictures.

## Getting Started

- First create an account as a tennis court renter or court seller
- Search for the court type, location, and price based on your search input
- You will be taken to an index page which shows the results of your search, and the relevant locations on the map.
- Then the user can book a court, or find out more information about the court
- If the user wishes to sell a court, they can now go through the process of uploading their court details
